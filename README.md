# Starting from scratch

- Start with a feature, not a layout. Don't worry about navigation, logos or footers. Begin designing what will offer value to the user.
- Don't obsess over details.
- Start by designing in grayscale. It forces you to focus on structure, space and fonts.
- Don't design too much.
- Work in cycles.
- Choose a personality e.g. a banking system may have a personality of trust, security and professionalism.
- Fonts play a huge role in design. Choose wisely. Playful look, use rounded sans serif. For a professional look, use a serif font.
- When picking a color, think about the mood you want to convey and what looks good for you.
- Border radius makes it feel more playful and friendly.
- Limit your choices. It makes it easier to make decisions when designing. Colors, fonts, etc.
- You don't have to design the entire system upfront, but look for patterns and reuse them. Shadows, radius, opacity, colors, font sizes, etc.

# Hierarchy is everything

- When everything in an interface is competing for attention, it feels noisy and
  chaotic, like one big wall of content where it’s not clear what actually
  matters.
- Make an effort to highlight what matters and de-emphasize what doesn’t.
- Don't only use size to convey importance. Use font weights, colors, spacing, etc.
- Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work — they can work for
  large headings but are too hard to read at smaller sizes. If you’re considering
  Size isn’t everything 34
  using a lighter weight to de-emphasize some text, use a lighter color or
  smaller font size instead.
